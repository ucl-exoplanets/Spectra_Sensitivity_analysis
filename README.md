# Interpreting deep learning models for exoplanet atmospheric retrievals
_Work in Progress_

## Summary
This is a code repository for the paper: Peeking inside the Black Box: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals

## How to use it
The implementation provide two ways to use it:

### Model Training
For those who would like to train a model and use the sensitivity test, you can run the following command in the terminal: 

```python runfile.py```

### Sensitivty test
For those who would like to use the sensitivity functionality only, you may do so by either importing the script
